# EX-IOExpander

EX-IOExpander is an I/O expander for EX-CommandStation utilising one or more additional microcontrollers as both analogue and digital I/O devices.

While there are many hardware I/O expander devices on the market, current supply issues are making these difficult to acquire and have driven some prices up significantly, so there is benefit to be had in utilising less expensive microcontrollers for this purpose, especially those less capable devices that have been set aside as they no longer meet new software requirements.

The initial release will have support for Arduino AVR platforms (Uno, Nano, and Mega), allowing all digital GPIO ports to be used as digital inputs (with/without pullups) or outputs. Analogue ports will be able to be used for for anlogue inputs or digital inputs/outputs.
