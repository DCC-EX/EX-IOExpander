Expectation that the bytes coming in will specify which ports are being set/reset.

Function to set/reset should be something like:

pinMode(port, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(port, HIGH/LOW);

How to get port list from bytes received?

Expectation this function also needs to perform the initial device setup for which
ports are inputs vs. outputs?

When MCP23017 device is created, there is nothing to define which ports are input vs. output.
How to deal with this so input ports are polled?

Expectation that the input ports are known already when this device initialises.

Is this set during initilisation of registers etc. when device is first connected to?

Will need to have some sort of global buffer setup to be updated during the main loop().

This function will need to convert that buffer into bytes to be sent via Wire.write().
